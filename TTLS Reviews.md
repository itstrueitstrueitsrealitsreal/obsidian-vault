## Challenges
### Cross-domain collaboration
High coupling across different domains and business lines, and the POC of a requirement might not be the same person who worked on the feature
- examples: human moderation, VVR, Model Sampling
### Balancing implementation resistance, cost, and business risk management
- Need to ensure trust between product, ops, R&D and business alignment before moving on
- Need to ensure communication and alignment between different stakeholders before moving forward
### Priority and Expectation Management
- Outline the returns, risks, and priorities
- Current priorities:
	- Human moderation
	- Machine moderation
	- Gateway
