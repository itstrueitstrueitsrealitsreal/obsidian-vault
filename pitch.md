# intro
im sure you guys are familiar with how cutthroat and elitist the tech space is right now, with massive layoffs happening every other day.

so we saw this and decided to make a github dev portfolio pvp app to perpetuate this.

using our app, you can use AI to have a PVP match between two github profiles, comparing the profiles based on github activity.

during this project, we used openai to decide which of the github profiles are better, based on the results returned by the github api.
